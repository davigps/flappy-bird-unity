# Unity's Flappy Bird

## About

The assets and main idea behind this project are from this great tutorial of NoobsTuts. The aim was to improve Unity's main concepts necessary to build this game. After the tutorial, I improved the final game by making randomly generated obstacles, points and added free sound effects.

`Attention: Only play on portrait mode.`
