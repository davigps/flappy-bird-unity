# Unity's Flappy Bird

## About

The assets and main idea behind this project is from [this great tutorial of NoobsTuts](https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-flappy-bird-game). The aim was to improve unity main concepts necessary to build this game. I followed the tutorial, as well as, improve the final game, making randomly generated obstacles, gui points count and added free sound effects.

`Attention: Only play on portrait mode.`
